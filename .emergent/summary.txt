<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user requested the creation of a modern, cinematic, and minimal landing page to serve as an audiovisual portfolio for a filmmaker named David Antúnez.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
-   **Style:** Minimalist, cinematic, dark mode, large visuals, smooth animations, and modern typography ('Space Grotesk' was chosen).
-   **Structure:**
    -   **Hero Section:** Fullscreen background video showreel, with no text or buttons.
    -   **About Me Section:** A short personal bio with a profile photo.
    -   **Portfolio Section:** A grid gallery for video and photography projects. Clicks on projects should be disabled for now.
    -   **Contact Section:** Social media links (Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn) and an email address. The contact form was explicitly removed.
-   **Admin Panel:** A secure area () for the user to manage their projects (add, edit, delete).
-   **Backend:** A database to store project information and user credentials.

**User's preferred language**: Catalan/Spanish. The user started in English but switched to Catalan and Spanish. The next agent MUST respond in Catalan or Spanish to match the user's language.

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application (React frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB) has been developed. The frontend is a single-page portfolio with a hero section (displaying a YouTube video), an About Me section, a portfolio grid using mock data, and a contact footer with social links. A complete backend and a functional admin panel exist for user authentication and project management (CRUD). The user has already been provided with credentials to access the admin panel.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The user requested to add rounded corners to the hero section video after previously asking to make it fullscreen edge-to-edge. The agent was in the process of applying CSS classes ( and padding) to the video container in  to achieve this effect.
-   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** screenshot tool
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1:** Hero video style is inconsistent with user requests. (Priority: P0)

**Issues Detail:**
-   **Issue 1: Hero video style is inconsistent with user requests.**
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The hero video has been a point of frequent changes. It has been toggled between a fullscreen, edge-to-edge display and a padded, rounded-corner display. The last action was to add rounded corners back. This back-and-forth indicates the user is not satisfied with the visual outcome.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Use the  tool to verify the current implementation of rounded corners in .
        2.  Analyze the screenshot to see if the rounded corners are visible and if the implementation has introduced any new issues like black bars or incorrect spacing, which happened in previous attempts.
        3.  Present the result to the user for confirmation before proceeding.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** To finalize the visual design of the most prominent element of the landing page and satisfy the user's aesthetic requirements.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Is recurring issue?** Y
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** None

**In progress Task List**:
There are no tasks currently in progress. The last work was an issue fix.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    -   **P0: Fully Integrate Portfolio with Backend:** The portfolio grid on the main page currently uses mock data as a fallback. This task involves removing the mock data from  and ensuring it fetches and displays projects exclusively from the backend API ().
    -   **P1: Implement Direct Image Upload Feature:** The agent proposed adding a direct image upload feature to the admin panel so the user doesn't need to rely on external services like Imgur for project thumbnails and gallery images. The user has not yet approved this, so confirmation is needed before implementation.
-   **Future Tasks:**
    -   **P2: Implement Project Detail Pages:** The original request included pages for individual projects. The user later asked to disable clicks on the portfolio grid. Once the main page is stable, the agent should propose re-enabling clicks and building out the project detail pages (e.g., at a route like ).
    -   **P3: Deploy the Application:** The user has inquired about deployment. Once the user is satisfied with the features and content, the next step is to deploy the application and assist with connecting a custom domain if they have one.
    -   **P4: Cleanup Unused Code:** Since the contact form was removed, the backend endpoints (), data model (), and admin component () are now dead code and should be removed to clean up the codebase.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   None. The agent has been responsive to all reported issues, though some solutions have been iterative.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   N/A

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Axios, React Router
-   **Backend:** FastAPI, Motor (async MongoDB driver), Pydantic
-   **Database:** MongoDB
-   **Architecture:** Full-stack with a RESTful API connecting the frontend and backend.
-   **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication for the admin panel.

**key DB schema**
-   **users:** 
-   **projects:** 
-   **contacts:**  (Table exists but is no longer used by the application)

**changes in tech stack**
-   No changes from the initial stack.

**All files of reference**
-   : The file most frequently modified to handle user feedback on the hero video's appearance.
-   : Contains the core backend logic, including all API endpoints and database models.
-   : Needs to be updated to remove mock data.
-   : Contains the routing for both the public site and the admin panel.
-    & : Modified to implement the custom Space Grotesk font.
-   : A new directory containing all components for the admin interface.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The backend logic currently in  should be fully modularized into separate files under  and  to improve maintainability.
-   Unused contact form-related code (backend API endpoints in , model in , and admin component ) should be removed.

**key api endpoints**
-   
-   
-   
-   
-   (Unused) 

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The user is highly focused on the visual aesthetics, especially the hero video. Be prepared for iterative feedback on design elements. The user has repeatedly asked to add and remove rounded corners on the hero video.
-   The user's language is Catalan/Spanish. Communication must be in one of these languages.
-   The portfolio grid currently uses mock data. A top priority should be to connect it fully to the backend API.
-   The user requested to disable clicks on portfolio items. This was a change from the original plan. Before building project detail pages, confirm with the user if they want to re-enable this functionality.

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken:** No part of the application is critically broken.
-   **Mocked:** The portfolio component on the homepage () still relies on mock data as a fallback, despite a functional backend API being available.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   **YouTube:** Used for the hero section background video embed. No API key required.
-   **Google Fonts:** Used to import the 'Space Grotesk' font.
-   **Imgur:** Used by the user to provide an image for the About Me section. Not a direct integration.

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes:** NO
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO
-   **Test files created:** []
-   **Known regressions:** Portfolio items are no longer clickable links. This was an intentional change requested by the user.

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   **Admin URL:** 
-   **Email:** 
-   **Password:** 

**What agent forgot to execute**
-   The agent did not remove the now-unused backend code (API endpoints, models) and admin panel components related to the contact form after the user requested its removal from the frontend.
-   The agent did not fully complete the integration of the frontend portfolio component with the backend, leaving a mock data fallback in place.</analysis>
